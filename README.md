# Neural_Network_Perceptron_Convergence
Creating simple perceptron from scratch and trying to train it to classify two linear separable classes. visualize the change of the weight vector respect to every iteration.

# Separation line in first iteration (random weights at the beginning)

# Changing of separation line due to updating the weight vector every iteration during the training process

# Eventually the perceptron succeed in separating the data no matter what the value of the threshold is
